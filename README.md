<h2>Project Reflection</h2>

<h3>Designing Software</h3>
<p>
I approach designing software by first identifying the requirements and breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. This project helped me develop new design skills, such as planning an engaging 2D animation layout and balancing visual appeal with functionality. I followed a process that started with creating a basic working version, then gradually adding features like varied brick types, realistic ball physics, and player controls. These tactics—planning in stages, building in layers, and testing frequently—are strategies I can apply to any future work to ensure a stable and well-structured result.

<p>
This project strengthened my ability to design interactive elements that are both functional and visually appealing. I learned how to combine user controls, collision mechanics, and varied visual elements into one cohesive experience while keeping performance in mind. I started with a minimal viable version, then expanded feature by feature. Each addition was tested in isolation before being fully integrated, and this staged approach can be applied to any future project to reduce errors, improve maintainability, and make adding features easier.

<h3>Developing Programs</h3>
<p>
When developing programs, I focus on modularity, reusability, and continuous testing. I separate core logic from rendering and keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities. While working on my 3D scene, I applied strategies like using helper functions for collision detection, separating physics from rendering, and dynamically adjusting values for fine-tuning. These improved both clarity and flexibility.
</p>
<p>
Iteration was essential in my workflow. I would implement a basic version of a feature, test it, then refine it. This allowed me to catch issues early and improve performance and visual quality without starting over. Over the milestones, my approach became more organized. I moved from adding features in a single block of code to structuring them into well-defined, reusable components, which made the final integration smoother and more stable.

<h3>Reaching My Goals Through Computer Science</h3>
<p>
Computer science equips me with the problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and creativity to design and implement impactful applications. It gives me tools to tackle both practical and innovative projects. Working with computational graphics gave me insight into rendering techniques, real-time interactivity, and performance optimization, which will strengthen my understanding of computer science fundamentals in future coursework.
</p>
<p>
Professionally, these skills prepare me to create interactive tools, simulations, and visualizations that improve communication, data analysis, and user experiences. They are valuable in industries like game development, simulation, and data visualization, where both technical precision and creativity are essential.
